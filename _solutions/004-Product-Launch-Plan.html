# FAQ data
#--------------------
faqs:
  - question: "Can everyone on the product launch team access the plan online?"
    answer: "Yes, and you control their access permission.  For example, 'timesheet' permission lets them view the plan, set tasks complete, and enter timesheets."
  - question: "Do people that I share the plan with need to pay for GamePlan?"
    answer: "No, Viewer licenses for GamePlan are free.  A Viewer license still allows people to set tasks complete and enter timesheets, so you can track their progress."
  - question: "Can I get the product launch template shown in the images above?"
    answer: "Yes, however please note that this is a high level plan that only contains marketing tasks.  Also, task effort has not been estimated.  However, it is still a good example of how to use GamePlan.  Please contact us through the website and we'll share it with you."
  - question: "Do I need special hardware to use GamePlan?"
    answer: "GamePlan requires a personal computer, either PC or Mac.  Tablets are not yet supported.  Like all graphical applications, you should use an external mouse.  Because GamePlan is a cloud application, an internet connection is required."
  - question: "Which applications can GamePlan import data from?"
    answer: "GamePlan can import data from Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Project, and from Primavera P6 through a XER file."

<p class="u-fs-22">
    Many departments are involved in a product launch, so you need one plan that each department contributes to and works from.
</p>
<p class="u-fs-22">
    With GamePlan, everyone understands the project plan because it\'s visual.  Teams stay focused on completing their tasks because they know their impact on the launch.

        <p class="u-fs-22">
            Planning makes you consider all aspects of a project, which results in far fewer surprises later.
        </p>
        <p class="u-fs-22">
            Planning shows the project\'s critical path (with red arrows).  These are the tasks that will impact the launch date if they run late.

    title="Scheduling"
    content='
<p class="u-fs-22">
    As you visually plan, GamePlan creates a resource-leveled project schedule.  The schedule is achievable because each person\'s availability is considered and no one is double-booked.
</p>
<p class="u-fs-22">
    The project schedule is shown in the Gantt chart immediately below the Whiteboard.
</p>

<div class="media mt-4">

            Benefits of Scheduling
        </h2>
        <p class="u-fs-22">
            The schedule shows you the earliest possible product launch date given the work required and each person\'s availability.
        </p>
        <p class="u-fs-22">
            The schedule shows everyone exactly when they need to start and finish their tasks in order to keep the product launch on time.

    title="Tracking"
    content='
<p class="u-fs-22">
    After the project starts, tracking keeps everything up to date.  Tracking is done by marking tasks as <i>Completed on Schedule</i> or entering timesheets.
</p>
<div class="media mt-4">
    <div class="media-body">
        <h2>
            Benefits of Tracking
        </h2>
        <p class="u-fs-22">
            Tracking keeps the schedule valid, so everyone can rely on it.  When there\'s a delay or when a task takes longer than expected, the downstream schedule updates.
        </p>
        <p class="u-fs-22">
            Tracking the project shows the project status. How far through the project are you?  When will you be ready to launch?  This information is always known.
        </p>
        <p class="u-fs-22">
            Tracking also gives you a permanent record of plan versus actuals.  Analysing this data in a project post-mortem is a valuable learning experience that improves future planning.
